HOW TO INSTALL
downlaod python 3.9 or higher from either the windows store(recommened if possible) or off the python website(requires edites to batch files)

INSTALL_DEPENDENCIES

make sure the folder it is installing my custom deps into is the right folder, I downloaded python 3.9 from the windows store, so if you got it from the website make sure it is the right folder, if you got it from the windows store then you are fine to run the file


ADMINTOOL_BOT	

make sure to edit this file, as you need to add your own bot token, and folder locations as well as your server ip and ports, if you are using this for one server make sure to read all the comments so you know what to remove so you can use this one server.


RUNNER

if you downloaded python from the website make sure to edit the runner.bat file and to change "python" to "py"
if you have the windows store downlaod, you are fine to run the file as is.

BOT ADMIN PREMISSION IN THE DISCORD

in your discord server open your server settings and look for intergrations, look for the bot after adding it to the server and add it so only a certen role of your choice and use the bot!
